bikeboston is a simple web app that uses the Google Maps JavaScript API v3 to display a map of Boston, showing the availability of bikes & empty bike docks for the Hubway bike sharing system. MBTA stations and real-time predictions of trains for those stations (for the Red, Orange and Blue lines) are also shown.

Enjoy!
